How to play the game:
 First complete the form on how many columns, rows and mines do you want to have, then hit the 'Start new game button.'
 Play the game by clicking on the fields one by one. Your goals is to reveal each field excluding the ones that contain a mine.
 To learn, where the mines are, check the field you have been clicked. If the field does not contain a number, there are no mines in the immediate vicinity.
 If you see a number in a field, that means that in the immediate vicinity there are that number of mines.
 It is possible to tag a field with the right mouse button. Do this, if you suspect that there is a mine underneath. This way you can ensure that you don't click that field by accident.
 To un-tag a field, right click on it again.
