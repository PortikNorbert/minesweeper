To learn, where the mines are, check the field you have been clicked. If the field does not contain a number, there are no mines in the immediate vicinity.
If you see a number in a field, that means that in the immediate vicinity there are that number of mines.
It is possible to tag a field with the right mouse button. Do this, if you suspect that there is a mine underneath. This way you can ensure that you don't click that field by accident.
To un-tag a field, right click on it again.
